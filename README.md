# Recommender system

I used dataset of recipes information lifted from: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes-menus, with the aim of acquiring knowlegde of the basic concepts of recommender systems.
Over 20k recipes listed by recipe rating, nutritional information and assigned category (sparse).
Use the 'full_format_recipes.json' file to interact with all recipe data.
